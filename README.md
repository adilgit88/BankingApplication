# CS 210 Final Project - Banking Application

## Project Summary
This project simulates a banking investment application in C++. It calculates and displays projected balances and earned interest over several years based on user input. It solves the problem of manual financial forecasting, helping users understand the impact of interest and deposits over time through both monthly-compounded and annual-compounded interest calculations.

## What I Did Well
I implemented accurate financial formulas and structured the program with clear logic and readable output. The use of nested loops to handle monthly interest calculations showcases modular and detailed handling of real-world scenarios.

## Areas for Improvement
If extended, I would add input validation with user re-prompts, file saving for reports, and additional security for stored data. These features would make the program more interactive, useful, and secure for real use.

## Most Challenging Part
The most difficult section was managing accurate interest calculations with monthly compounding and ensuring the output format stayed user-friendly. I overcame this using the `<iomanip>` library for alignment and tested different scenarios to verify results.

## Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my skills in input handling, loop control, and compound interest formulas. The precision formatting and nested loop logic are directly transferable to other real-world applications and coursework involving finance, simulations, or reports.

## Code Maintainability
The code is maintainable and adaptable due to consistent formatting, functionally grouped logic, and descriptive variable naming. Comments and clean structure make future updates, like GUI integration or feature expansions, easy to implement.
